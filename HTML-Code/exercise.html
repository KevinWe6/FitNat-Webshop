      <div class="box1">
        <p id="texthome1">To perform a calf raise, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands resting on a wall or a stable surface for support.
          Slowly rise up onto the balls of your feet, lifting your heels off the ground while keeping your core engaged and your body aligned.
          Hold the raised position for a brief moment, feeling the contraction in your calf muscles.
          Then, slowly lower your heels back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the movement.
          Repeat the exercise for a desired number of repetitions, gradually increasing the intensity by adding weights or performing the exercise on an elevated surface.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="box2">
        <p id="texthome2">Place a chair behind you, ensuring that it is stable and won't slide or tip over during the exercise.
          Stand facing away from the chair and position your hands on the edge of the seat, gripping the front edge with your palms facing downward.
          Step forward a few feet away from the chair and extend your legs forward, keeping your heels on the ground and your knees slightly bent.
          Lower your body by bending your elbows and allowing your body to descend towards the ground until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below.
          Push through your palms and straighten your elbows to raise your body back up to the starting position, focusing on using your triceps to perform the movement.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box5">
        <p id="texthome3">Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward.
          Keep your upper arms close to your sides, and with a controlled motion, curl the dumbbells upward by bending your elbows while keeping your wrists straight.
          Continue lifting the dumbbells until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
          Hold the contracted position for a brief moment, squeezing your biceps.
          Slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="box7">
        <p id="texthome4">Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider, ensuring your feet are flat on the ground and toes slightly turned out.
          Engage your core, keep your chest lifted, and begin to lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if you were sitting back into a chair.
          Aim to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as close to parallel as you comfortably can.
          Pause briefly in the lowered position, then push through your heels and extend your legs to rise back up to the starting position.
          Keep your knees tracking over your toes and maintain proper alignment throughout the movement.</p>
